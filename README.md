# LOW/S

LOW/S is my custom operating system.

This is a rough readme, and will not be written formally. This will change as time goes on.

## Why am I making this?

Simple. Three reasons:

1. I think it's fun.
1. I want to learn more about the inner-workings of an operating system. What better than to make one from scratch?
1. Bragging rights? Maybe?

## End Goals

To be clear, I am not making this to be the "next" OS. I am making this purely for the reasons stated above. At no point will I be interested in marketing this or trying to make a replacement for modern operating systems--I am one person, and I am only doing this in my free time.

Otherwise, some end goals are:

1. Shell access
    1. I am unsure if I want to replicate Unix's Bash, another system's shell, or roll my own entirely.
1. Custom libc implementation
1. Custom compiler, assembler, linker, etc.
1. No GUI or networking until *much* later on.
1. Multi-threaded, multi-processing OS
1. Virtual memory
1. amd64 support
    1. I will most likely only target i386 in the interim.
1. Other things I can't think of right now.

# Contribution

I am not making any official contribution guidelines until later on. Feel free to contact me or make a pull/merge request or issue if you'd like to.

# Licensing

For now, this will be copyright by me, but I will likely use a modified C-Ware license later on.
